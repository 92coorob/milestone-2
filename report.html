    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p></p>
   
   <p><strong>Pluses: </strong><ul> <li>We were very helpful towards each other and are willingly to go the extra mile to help
the others who had problems for their own part.</li>
<li>The effort that each member put in was great and we had many discussions on how to improve the site.</li>
<li>We had good teamwork and rapport.</li>
<li>Each of the members did their part diligently and did not push away their responsibilities.</li></ul></p>
    
	<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> <ul><li>We often are unable to finish the our part before group meetings due to workload from other modules.</li>
	<li>There were some disagreements to the site which led to several disputes.</li>
	<li>There were instances where the pressure of the workload gets heavier and some of us lost our temper during group meetings.</li>
	<li>There were also some miscommuncations within the group that led to a dispute.</li></ul></p>
    
	<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> <ul><li>We manage to input Javascript codes that were not taught to us during
our lessons, into our website.</li>
<li>There was one instance where the webpage was not functioning due a punctuation error and we took approximately an hour
to find that mistake.</li>
<li>The use of Javascript has made our website more interactive and user-friendly.</li></ul></p>


<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
<p>Although we had some disputes when we had discussions, we manage to solve it amicably and compromise. Some of the team members 
had great ideas and we decided to input them in our site. Creating this site was not an easy task as we also had to balance our
work with other modules. There were also times where all of us were stuck due to the complexity of the code but we helped
each other out. All of us had put in a lot of effort into this site and we were satisfied with our
final product. </p>
